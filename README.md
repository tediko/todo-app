## Overview

### Intro
Hello! This is my solution to [Todo App - Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW) challenge.

### The challenge

> Your challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as
> close to the design as possible.
> 
> You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So
> if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a
> go.
> 
> Your users should be able to:
> 
> -View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
> - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
> - Add new todos to the list
> - Mark todos as complete
> - Delete todos from the list
> - Filter by all/active/complete todos
> - Clear all completed todos
> - Toggle light and dark mode
> - Bonus: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

 - Flexbox
 - SCSS
 - Javascript
 - Semantic HTML5 markup
 - LocalStorage
 - Sortable.js
 - JS Animations

### Features

- Todos and theme are stored in Local Storage.
- Drag and drop to reorder items using library Sortable.js. Reordered items are also stored in Local Storage.
- When the list is empty, or there is nothing to display in the "Completed" tab, I was missing the information that there was nothing to display. I added it.
- I created a toast notification pop up in various events. (Adding todo / incorrectly entered input / Removing todo / clearing all.)
